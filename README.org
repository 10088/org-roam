* Org-roam (âš  Early in Development)

Rudimentary [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam]] replica in Org-mode. This brings the benefits of the
graph-like note-taking tool to Org-mode, without custom Org syntax.

Here's a screenshot of ~org-roam~. The ~org-roam~ buffer shows
backlinks for the active org buffer in the left window, as well as the
surrounding content in the backlink file.

The backlink database is built asynchronously in the background, so
there will be no significant slowdown.
