* Org-roam

** About

Org-roam is a rudimentary [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam]] replica in Org-mode. This project intends to adaptively implement the core features of Roam in org-mode and eventually introduce newer features suitable for the Emacs ecosystem. It offers a *non-hierarchical* notetaking approach which is *effortless* yet powerful. Notetaking becomes fluent and easy when you don't have to worry about /where/ a particular note should go --- you just start writing from anywhere about anything.

To know more about Roam, these following links are recommended.

The best way to understand the usefulness of this approach is to actually try it.


** Project Status

As of February 2020, it is in a very early stage of development. 


** Screenshot

Here's a screenshot of ~org-roam~. The ~org-roam~ buffer shows backlinks for the active org buffer in the left window, as well as the surrounding content in the backlink file.
The backlink database is built asynchronously in the background, so there will be no significant slowdown.

** Installation

You need to have [[https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/][deft]] installed. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package deft
    :after org
    :bind
    ("C-c n d" . deft)
    :custom
    (deft-recursive t)
    (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
    (deft-default-extension "org")
    (deft-directory "~/org-files/")
    (deft-use-filename-as-title t))

  (use-package org-roam
    :after deft org
    :straight (:host "github" :repo "jethrokuan/org-roam")
    :bind
    ("C-c n l" . org-roam)
    ("C-c n t" . org-roam-today)  
    ("C-c n i" . org-roam-insert))
#+end_src

*Failback installation*:

Clone the git repo locally and in your emacs init.el put something like 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/Downloads/org-roam")
  (require 'org-roam)
#+end_src


** Quickstart

Toy scenario: Suppose you want to keep track of all the cool-facts you come across, but it is really effortsome to everytime find the exact file to note an individual cool-fact. 

1. Open a deft file and start writing about anything. Now in any sentence you can call the function ~org-roam-insert~ and choose the filename ~cool-facts~ and then keep on writing whatever you want.

2. Later when you open ~cool-facts.org~ and call ~org-roam~ you will see all the places you have referenced this file. So all the cool-facts you have writen anywhere in your deft database are easily accessible from here.
